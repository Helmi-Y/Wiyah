    now: "You made it baby, I am so so so excited that you made it here and I've been waiting for this for sooo long. Here is something I made for when you leave and so that we can be close with each other even with the distance. Whenever you feel a certain way, open one of these messages, and I hope it'll make you feel better. The message should tell you to send me something, and once you do that, I will change the message so that the next time you feel that way, you'll get a different one. I love you so much baby and I hope we will have a good week ðŸ’œ",
